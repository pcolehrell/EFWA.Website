      <p>I wear my father’s old jeans, and my mother’s silk dresses. The fabric is softened by their movements, now overlaid with my own. In their weight and wear, I feel the closeness of gesture, repetition, care. This is where my work begins — with the quiet, tactile bonds between people and clothes.</p>

      <p>As a Fashion History and Theory student at Central Saint Martins, I am drawn to storytelling — those embedded in garments, and those we create through wearing, mending, and remembering. My background in fashion design, also at CSM, taught me to observe the material logic of clothing, to notice the way a garment holds shape, strain, and softness. I carry this sensitivity into my research, which often begins with the physical object and unfolds outward — into questions of identity, memory, and social context.</p>

      <p>I am particularly interested in denim. It is a fabric worn by many, shaped by everyone, and yet still capable of holding something deeply personal. Denim’s presence in pop culture, its cycles of rebellion and conformity, its marketing and myth — these are not separate from the emotional lives of its wearers. I am curious about this tension: between the commercial and the intimate, between universality and individuality. Jeans, perhaps more than any other garment, illustrate how clothing can be both disposable and unforgettable.</p>

      <p>My practice weaves haptic knowledge into each piece — how we come to understand through touch, and how garments store traces of this knowledge. I mend my own clothes and those of people I love. These small repairs are not about perfection — they are about paying attention, and prolonging the relationships we have with our clothes. Each stitch is a way of staying close, of slowing down, of framing wear as evidence of life.</p>

      <p>I am interested in the role of the writer, curator, and researcher as translator — someone who can bridge technical, emotional, and historical understandings of dress. I want to explore how we communicate the richness of clothing’s lived experience without flattening it, how we invite others to see, feel, and listen. At its heart, my work explores what we wear and why — and what those choices might tell us about care, circumstance, and connection.</p>

      <p>Outside of my research, I find rhythm and restoration in walking, outdoor swimming, ballet, cooking and sharing good food (especially anything with salt and vinegar or dark chocolate), travel — both near and far — and regular visits to my much-loved local bookshops.</p>
